FORMAT OF BONE FILES

In the musculoskeletal modeling software, a body segment consists of
one or more bones.  The bones that make up each body segment are 
specified as shown in the following example.

beginsegment   FEMUR
name   right_femur
files:  1
filenames:   r_femur.dat
endsegment

The files listed in the definitions of the body segments (e.g.  
r_femur.dat) define the polygon meshes that describe the bone surfaces.
These files list the 3D coordinates of the polygon vertices (in a 
vertex list) and define how the vertices are connected to form polygons 
(in a polygon list).  The reference frame that is associated with each 
body segment serves as the coordinate system for the polygon vertices.  
The first number on each line of the polygon list specifies the number 
of vertices in the polygon; the rest of the numbers on the line are the 
vertices in that polygon.  For example, the first polygon in the 
polygon list has three vertices, which are the first three vertices in 
the vertex list.  The format of the bone files is shown below.

Delp, Ph.D.<BR>Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Physical Medicine andRehabilitation, Northwestern University, Sensory Motor Performance Program,Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.</CENTER><H3>BACKGROUND</H3>This data set provides that parameters needed to develop a computer modelof the human lower limb.  It is based on a model developed at the VARehabilitation R&amp;D Center in Palo Alto California from 1987-1990.All data may be used and copied for non-commercial use.The dataset includes descriptions of bone surfaces, joint kinematics, muscle linesof action, and muscle force-generating parameters.  This data allows one tocalculate the lengths, moment arms, forces, and joint moments generated byforty three muscles of the lower limb.  The data set is presented inseveral files.  <P>The <A HREF="delp_mus">"Muscle_input_file"</A> includes:<BR>(1) a dimensionless force-length curve for tendon,<BR>(2) dimensionless force-length curves for muscle,<BR>(3) a dimensionless force-velocity curve for muscle,<BR>(4) definitions of forty-three lower limb muscles.  The definition of eachmuscle contains a list of coordinates that describe its line of action andthe parameters (peak isometric force, optimal fiber length, tendon slacklength, and pennation angle) needed to compute isometric muscle force.A more readable <A HREF="Muscle_parameter_table.txt"> summary of musculotendon parameters</A>is given in a separate table.<P>The <A HREF="delp_jnt">"Joint_kinematic_file"</A> includes kinematic descriptions of the hip,knee, ankle, subtalar, and metatarsophalangeal joints.<P>The <A HREF="bones/index.html">"bones directory"</A> includes approximate surface geometry for the bones ofthe lower limb. The format of these files is described in a file called<A HREF="bones/format_of_bone_files.txt">"bone file format."</A>  You can download surface geometry for the<A HREF="bones/pelvis.txt">pelvis</A>,<A HREF="bones/femur.txt">femur</A>,<A HREF="bones/pat.txt">patella</A>,<A HREF="bones/tibia.txt">tibia</A>,<A HREF="bones/fibula.txt">fibula</A>,<A HREF="bones/talus.txt">talus</A>,<A HREF="bones/foot.txt">foot</A>, and<A HREF="bones/bofoot.txt">toes</A>.  The patella, tibia,fibula, andbones of the foot were provided by Don Stredney of the Ohio State University.<H3>FORMAT OF THE DATA SET</H3>The data set is organized according to the structure of the input files for<A HREF="http://www.musculographics.com">SIMM</A> (Software for Interactive Musculoskeletal Modeling).  An overview ofthis software and file formats is given in Delp, S.L. and Loan, J.P.: Asoftware system to develop and analyze models of musculoskeletalstructures, Computers in Biology and Medicine, vol. 25, pp. 21-34, 1995.<H3>LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL</H3>There are several important limitations of the computer model described bythis data set.  The computer model represents a normal, adult male and isbased on parameters that were compiled in several different experimentalstudies. The details of the lower limb model and some of its limitationsare described in the publications listed below.USERS OF THIS DATA MUST TAKE THERESPONSIBILITY TO TEST AND EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF THE MODEL IN THECONTEXT OF THEIR APPLICATION.

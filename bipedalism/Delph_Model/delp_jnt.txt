JOINT INPUT FILE FOR USE WITH THE 7 SEGMENT KINEMATIC MODEL  OF THE LOWER
EXTREMITY CREATED BY SCOTT L. DELP

This joint file specifies the four components (1) body segments, (2)
generalized coordinates, (3) joints, and (4) kinematic functions of the
lower-limb model.  These four components are described below.

(1) body segments - The bones that make up each body segment are listed.

(2) generalized coordinates - Each generalized coordinate (gencoord) is
defined.  These define the ranges of motion  for each degree-of-freedom
(joint angle).

(3) joints - Each joint is defined.  Each translation and rotation is
defined by a sum of constants and functions.  For example, "tx 2 constant
1.0 function f2(gencoord)" means that tx (x-translation) is a sum of two
components. The first is the constant, 1.0, and the second is function2 of
gencoord.  An example joint definition is shown here.

beginjoint (FRAME1,FRAME2) /* Begins definition of joint between 2 frames.
name funnyjoint            /* Names joint connecting frame1 and frame2.    
     
order  t r3 r1 r2          /* Specifies order of translation and rotations.
tx 1 constant .07          /* Translations between the frames are all   
ty 1 constant .06          /* constants in this example.  However, they
tz 1 constant .08          /* could be functions of the gencoords. (e.g., knee)
axis1 1.0 0.0 0.0          /* Defines the directions of the rotation axes.
axis2 0.0 1.0 0.0          /* In this example they are the same as the X, Y,
axis3 0.0 0.0 1.0          /* and Z-axes, but they need not be (e.g., ankle).
r3 1 function f1(gencoord1)/* Rotation about axis 3 is a f(gencoord1).
r2 1 function f2(gencoord2)/* Rotation about axis 2 is a f(gencoord2).
r1 1 constant 0.0          /* Rotation about axis 1 is a constant = 0.0.
endjoint

(4) kinematic functions - The pairs of points that define each kinematic
function are specified.  These points, when interpolated by a natural cubic
spline, define each of the functions that specify the kinematics of the
joints.  The first number in each pair is the independent variable
(gencoord value). The second number is the value of the dependent variable
(translation or rotation).

LOCATION OF REFERENCE FRAMES
The locations of the frames are as follows.
      
PELVS:  The pelvic reference frame is fixed at the midpoint of the line
connecting the two ASIS.
FEMUR:  The femoral frame is fixed at the center of the femoral head
TIBIA:   The tibial segment is located at the mid point of the line between
the medial and lateral femoral epicondyles (see note below›).
PATELLA: The patellar frame is located at the most distal point of the patella.
TALUS:   The talar frame is located at the midpoint of the line between the
apices of the medial and lateral maleoli.
CALCANEUS: The calcaneal frame is located at the most distal, inferior
point on the posterior surface of the calcaneus.
TOES:    The toe frame is located at the base of the second metatarsal 

In the anatomical position, the X-axes point anteriorly, the Y-axes point
superiorly, and the Z-axes point laterally.  Also note that this muscle
file must be used with a joint file that has the same reference segments.

›The coordinates of the tibial tuberosity in the tibia frame are  t  =
(0.039, -0.082, 0.000).  The origin of the tibia reference frame could be
moved to the tibial tuberosity using t.  To do this, t would need to be
subtracted from all the muscle points in the tibia segment and from the
vertices in tibia and fibula bone files.  Also, the translations in the
femur-tibia joint, the tibia-patella joint, and the tibia-talus joint would
need to be transformed.

 TX and TY for femoral-tibial kinematics were determined by the following

line of length 5.5 cm.  I then determined the translations that make the
ellipse (femur) and the line (tibia) contact according to Nissel's data
(1985) for tibial-femoral contact.

TIBIA-PATELLA KINEMATICS
TX and TY for tibial-patellar motion were determined by assuming that the
patellar ligament is inextensible and has length 5.5cm.  The patellar
ligament angle was taken from Yamaguchi and Zajac (1989) because it fits
experimental data (Nissel, 1985 and VanEijden, 1985) well. From patellar
length and angle, tx and ty were computed.  I subtracted 8mm from the tx
values because the tibial tuberosity of my bone model is too large. 
Effectively, subtracting the 8mm reduces the size of the tuberosity.  RZ
was taken directly from VanEijden, 1985.  I subtracted 5 degrees from rz
values because my patella model was oriented with 5 degrees offset.  I
compared the display of the knee kinematics to xerograms of knee in four
different positions.  I also compared knee moment arms to experimental
data.

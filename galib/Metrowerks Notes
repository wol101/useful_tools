Metrowerks Notes

For some bizarre reason, Metrowerks is giving link errors when comparing enumerated types
saying that the required operator== is undefined. This has been fixed in some cases by
explicitly casting the enum to an int. This shouldn't be necessay but nor should it do
any harm either. I had to do it so many times that I've not commented the changes except
at the top of the file.
